# SQL DATABASE PROJECT

TechFlow is a business specializing in the sale of IT products, such as hardware components, accessories, and IT equipment, through physical stores and their e-commerce website.

It offers a wide range of IT products, and each product has a unique name, a detailed description, a price, and an available stock quantity. Products are categorized, and each category has a unique name. Additionally, each product is associated with a manufacturer, which has a unique name and a country of origin.

TechFlow customers can place orders for available products through the e-commerce website. Orders contain information about the order date and the order status, indicating its state, such as "new," "confirmed," or "canceled." Details about the ordered products, such as quantity and unit price, are recorded in the system. Also, when placing an order, customers choose the shipping method.

To manage inventory, TechFlow records information about the physical stores it owns, including the store name and address. Additionally, employees working in the physical stores are registered in the system, with roles such as salesperson, cashier, or manager.

TechFlow customers have the option to leave reviews and feedback about purchased products. These reviews contain information about the author, the reviewed product, and the given rating.

Payments for placed orders are recorded in the system, along with information about the payment method used.

Furthermore, TechFlow offers wishlist functionality, where customers can add their favorite products to track and purchase later.
